[Slushnas]
##### Interface Changes
* The default method for opening files is now the "as messages" mode. This mainly affects opening files from the "Find Opcode In Files" dialog.
* The "Use Highlighting" checkbox will be unchecked and disabled when viewing a file in "as messages" mode as it was not designed for use in this mode.
* Fixed a bug where files opened in "as messages" mode could get highlighting applied when it shouldn't be. As a result, larger messages
will now load faster in some cases.
* You can now hit the Enter key in the Opcode box to start a search in the "Find Opcode In Files" dialog.

##### Other Changes
* Renamed Contract cooldown spell enum as it looks like it is shared for all contracts.

* Renamed lock related weenie errors as they apply to both chests and doors.
* Added enum and Guid conversions to lots of variables.
* Added initial support for the AllegianceUpdate event (0x0020) and AllegianceInfoResponseEvent (0x027C). There is a chance that character nodes will not be grouped correctly 
in the hierarchy but all data should be parsed.
* Fixed several housing messages: BuyHouse, Recv_HouseProfile, RentHouse, Recv_UpdateRentPayment, and Recv_AvailableHouses.
